  y,
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial"),
  K = NULL,
  eps = 1e-06,
  delta = 2,
  L = 50

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame of predictors}

\item{y}{Response vector}

\item{family}{"gaussian" or "binomial"}

\item{K}{Max model size (steps)}

\item{eps}{Minimum AIC improvement}

\item{delta}{AIC tolerance for near-ties}

\item{L}{Max models to retain per step}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"path_forest"} with models and AICs

Same as \code{\link{multi_path_forward}}
}
\description{
Wrapper for \code{\link{multi_path_forward}} to match assignment specification.
Builds multiple forward-selection paths by adding variables one at a time
and retaining all children within a ΔAIC window.

# Gaussian example
X <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(100), x2 = rnorm(100))
y <- 2*X$x1 - 1.5*X$x2 + rnorm(100)
forest <- build_paths(X, y, family = "gaussian", K = 5)
