Description: Implements a branching forward-selection search with AIC, resampling-based
    stability of features, and a plausible-model filter that combines AIC tolerance
    and average feature stability. Supports Gaussian (linear) and Binomial (logistic)
    families using base R 'glm'/'lm' and 'AIC' without external dependencies.
