Description: Implements multi-path forward selection for linear and logistic 
    regression models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Unlike 
    traditional stepwise selection that follows a single path, this package 
    explores multiple near-optimal variable selection paths simultaneously by 
    keeping models within a specified AIC tolerance. The package provides three 
    core functions: build_paths() performs multi-path forward selection, 
    stability() assesses variable stability through resampling (bootstrap or 
    subsample), and plausible_models() filters models based on both AIC quality 
    and average stability scores. This approach identifies reliable models that 
    are both statistically sound and robust to data perturbations, making it 
    particularly useful for exploratory analysis and variable selection in 
    high-dimensional settings. The stability assessment computes the proportion 
    of models each predictor appears in across resamples, providing an intuitive 
    measure of variable importance and reliability.
